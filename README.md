  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Added Level Select scene template</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Main Menu code fixed</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Coin Catcher level has the coin count in the bottom-left corner of the game, and the difficulty is random for now! ðŸŽ®</p>
    </li>
    <p>The random difficulty for the coin catcher minigame will we temporary for the normal game mode! But the player will have to pass the level to progress in the minigame.</p>
  <p>Otherwise, in the "Randomize!" mode, the difficulty will be random every time the game loads this minigame, or other future minigames with level difficulty.</p>
    <p>I want the game to be dynamic and fun to play, so i will be implementing all the changes needed for achieving that goal!</p>
